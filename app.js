Your first task is to identify the location that the story is situated, if it is available (if not, return {location: null} as the first item in the response array). Your second task will be to extract the names of individuals who are quoted as saying something in the text, their gender, and their connection to the subject of the story or the reason for their inclusion in the story. 
                
                **IMPORTANT: Only include individuals who are providing supplementary comments or perspectives who could be replaced by others of similar background, experiences or expertise. Exclude individuals who are the main subject(s) of the news article. Also, exclude individuals who are only mentioned but do not provide quotes.**

                Describe each individual's connection (or "role") in broad terms that explain why their perspectives are valuable to the story. This could be, for example, due to professional expertise, personal experiences or a shared background with other people mentioned in the story. Do not mention specific company names or overly detailed job titles, unless these details are key to the person's role in the story. 
                
                If the role is a professional one, phrase the result such that someone with a similar background or expertise could be found by searching for the role on a job site like LinkedIn, and put "yes" as the value for the key "linkedin". Otherwise put "no" for the key "linkedin" if the role is highly personal such as the relative of the main subject or a resident of a city, or the person's title is highly specific such as the Minister in charge of the area the story is about, whose perspective would be hard to replace. 
                
                State the individual's gender based on pronouns or honorifics used in reference to that individual (NOT anyone else they mention in their quote). If no clear indication is given, make an educated guess based on the name or other contextual clues. If it is ambiguous, such as if the name is gender neutral, the pronoun "they" is used to reference an individual, or there are no pronouns or honorifics used, state the gender as "unknown". Briefly provide reasons for your determination of the person's gender.

                Extract the quotes that are used, with each line containing a direct or indirect quote presented as a list item with the exact wording used in the text. There must be at least one quote for each individual included. Otherwise, omit that individual.
